## Notes
Color Selection:
    - There are 2 primary ways to select LED color: RGB and HSV
    - RGB: the simplest, integer values from 0-255 for the respective Red, Blue, Green fields
        - can set individual LED RGB values using dot notation
        - can use the setRGB function
    - HSV: determines the LED output via Hue, Saturation, Value
        - The Value field represents the Brightness

The LED strip:
    - GROUND = BLACK
    - POWER  = RED
    - DATA   = GREEN
        - Data pin can be any pin on the board, unlike when controlling single pins with PWM
